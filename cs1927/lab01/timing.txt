Explaining :

1. Considering the same input and the conditions for duplicates; the average time for random is always greater than the average time for sorted and reverse.
   This may because when the input numbers are random, computer will take more times to compare numbers one by one till the last one; 
   therefore, it takes more time.

2. Considering the same input and the conditions for duplicates; the average time for sorted and reverse are almost the same.
   This may because when the input numbers are already sorted in increment or in decrement, computer only need to compare the numbers from 
   the begining to the number that it needs; and then, it will not need to compare the number behind. Therefore, the average time for it is
   almost the same;

3. Considering the same conditions except the Input Size; the average time for larger Input Size is greater that for smaller Input Size.
   This may because when the Input Size is larger, the number that computer need to compare will increase. Therefore, it will take more time.

4. Considering the same conditions except thr Duplicates; the average time for having duplicates are almose the same as the time for not having 
   duplicates.
   This may because when the duplicates do not affect the efficiency of computing.

5. Only considering usel and sort, the average time for usel is greater than that for sort in most cases.
   This may because sort is more efficient than usel(not very sure).
